# J.A.R.V.I.S
Heyyyyyy, folks! I know it might sound a bit cringeworthy, but the first name that came to mind while creating this app was J.A.R.V.I.S, so I decided to name it J.A.R.V.I.S








#WORK_IN_PROGRESS
stay tuned for further updates
the first app would be a basic chat bot with voice command activated ( both the input and output ), the interface and looks would be the last thing to add.
will first create the basic chat-bot, train it, and then only will be published.
this work will either end up in this repository working perfectly or be in my trash bin.
and if u r tryna copy ma codes nicca, atleast add me in the credits tab. this might not be my most time consuming work, but one of my most enjoyed one. 
just message me on insta, my account is linked in the bio. i'll give the code there
